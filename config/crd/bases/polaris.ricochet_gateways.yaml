                  Addresses requested for this Gateway. This is optional and behavior can
                  depend on the implementation. If a value is set in the spec and the
                  requested address is invalid or unavailable, the implementation MUST
                  indicate this in the associated entry in GatewayStatus.Addresses.


                  The Addresses field represents a request for the address(es) on the
                  "outside of the Gateway", that traffic bound for this Gateway will use.
                  This could be the IP address or hostname of an external load balancer or
                  other networking infrastructure, or some other address that traffic will
                  be sent to.


                  If no Addresses are specified, the implementation MAY schedule the
                  Gateway in an implementation-specific manner, assigning an appropriate
                  set of Addresses.


                  The implementation MUST bind all Listeners to every GatewayAddress that
                  it assigns to the Gateway and add a corresponding entry in
                  GatewayStatus.Addresses.
